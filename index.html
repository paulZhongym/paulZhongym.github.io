                            the popup and some of these other sources will not be displayed). This setting should persist.</p>

                                <p>The popupView.jsx contains the React components that is used to render the HTML of the extension.</p>

                                    <p>The popupController.jsx exports a React functional component that uses the popupView.jsx to return the render component</p>
                                    <p>
                                    It then tells React to render the component in the popup-container div. The PopupController has a useEffect() hook that immediately:
                                    <li><p>microphone permission</p> </li>
                                    <li> <p>recording (creates a ShimRecorder and sends message to background script, calls startRecorder, which sends a message to background script to start recording, which is picked up by recorder.js and calls startRecording in voice.js)
                                    after rendering the popup.</p></li>
                                </p><p>
                                    The logic to handle recording is done in vad.js. It starts a WebRTC session and creates a Promise that contains either the voice data or an error.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It uses the native MediaRecorder API to record the voice and sends a message to the background script to temporarily mute other browser tabs. Once it finishes recording, it makes a POST request with the audio for speech recognition.
                                </p> <p>
                                    The PopupController receives the response and sends a message to the background script to run an intent. The intent runner then handles the actual running of the intent.</p>

                                <h4 id="line5_1">Why we chose to use Incremental Development Process <a href="#top">#back to top</a></h4>

                                <p>In the open source community, the requirements and specifications of a project may not be well defined in the beginning. Customers and users will request more features as they utilize the software and provide feedback to developers. They have to accommodate their changing requirements and expectations accordingly in the incremental development process. Furthermore, the Incremental Development Process allows developers to make changes at a relatively lower cost compared to other software development processes such as Waterfall. Customers can use the product earlier in alpha and beta phases to gain value, but also to provide valuable feedback to developers. On the development side, it is also a good idea to maximize the market share as soon as possible. 

                                </p>
                                <p>We also considered other software development processes. Firstly, waterfall development does not suit our needs in our open source project since we do not have a clear vision of all the requirements and specifications before we start working on the project. There are always new issues regarding new features on top of the existing ones. The inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes it very difficult for developers to collect feedback from users and make changes in the requirements accordingly. Reuse-oriented software development process is also a poor choice for our workflow, because the project focuses on an innovative voice command tool. As relatively new technology, there are limited components for us to reuse to implement voice navigation on browsers. The spiral process is good for analyzing product risks in every development phase iteratively. However, it is not a good choice because a voice command extension on Firefox is not a life critical product so there is a relatively low risk in the various phases of planning, implementation and delivery. The advantages of being able to identify and account for more risks in every development phase does not apply to our situation. In fact, the excessive amount of risk analysis is too costly for rapid development and delivery. </p> 
                                
                                <p>Although incremental development process suits our purpose the best for our voice command extension project, there are some drawbacks in incremental development process as well. It is not cost-effective to make documentation to every version of the software in a rapid development process since the requirements and specifications are too quickly. Furthermore, the system architecture tends to degrade as the development goes as more and more new features are added unless the development team spends extra time and energy to refactor the codebase. Otherwise, there is a risk for technical debt to pile up in the future as the software becomes harder to maintain and develop.

                                <h4 id="line5_2">Why we chose to use Kanban <a href="#top">#back to top</a></h4>
                                <p>There are several reasons as to why our team chose Kanban as our software development methodology. One of these reasons is the aspect of the Kanban board. We can customize the columns of the board to suit our teams needs as well as providing us the ability of visualizing our progress as we continue work on deliverables. The fact that Kanban emphasizes limiting the “Work in Progress” section on the board is a very good way of ensuring the highest quality of work that we deliver, without sacrificing delivery times. Another aspect of Kanban that could work very well for our team is the use of daily synchronization meetings in front of the Kanban board. These are used to help the team keep track of their tasks as well as being aware of the work other members are doing. Kanban works well because it has the concept of “everyone owns the board”. This means that instead of assigning roles to each member of the team, every single person is equally responsible in updating the board as there exists a collective responsibility among all members to collaborate with each other. Although we are given the requirements of each deliverable ahead of time, group projects can sometimes be unpredictable. Because of this, we appreciate the flexibility of Kanban as we can quickly pivot into pulling in different issues and re-assigning to members of the team.

                                <h4 id="line5_3">Comparing Kanban with Scrum and XP <a href="#top">#back to top</a></h4>
                                <p>One of the main aspects of XP is the idea of promoting strong engineering practices into the development of the tasks, as well as promoting an extremely strict priority order given by the customers. For Scrum, there is no need for a priority order, as the members of the team follow the order specified at the beginning of the iteration determined by the scrum master. For Kanban, our team uses the flexibility of pulling issues into the WIP section and moving issues into the “To-Do” sections when requirements tend to change so we can rapidly adjust to the constant changes. Since Scrum is very strict on the issues first discussed at the beginning of the iterations, we would not be allowed this type of flexibility. XP depends heavily on the priorities of the customer that we are dealing with. With the nature of an open source project, it would be difficult in communicating with the users as we do not have direct access into the company that is creating the project. Also, with Kanban, we can be more engaged in determining task priorities. Another aspect where Scrum differs is the idea of assigning roles to team members. Our team feels that we can be more effective with all members having an equal contribution level to the Kanban board, as well as priorities of the issues.

                                <h4 id="line5_4">How we are using Kanban <a href="#top">#back to top</a></h4>
                                <p>As a group, we have agreed on various aspects of the Kanban methodology in order to optimize for the schedules of the team members and ensure that we submit exceptional work for the deliverables. First, we have decided to use Trello as our Kanban board of choice (link below). Trello is free and easy to use and allows us to customize our board to how we see fit.</p>
                                     <p> For example, we have decided to use the following columns:</p> 
                                     <p>Backlog, To-Do, Doing, Testing, Review and Done. </p>
                                    <p> Each member is asked to update tasks on the Trello board progressively when working on an issue. 
                                        Group members will be responsible for reviewing the work of the other group members before 
                                        submitting the deliverables and is why we have included the “Review” column into our Trello board.
                                         A piece of customization that we have implemented into the board is limiting the “Doing” section with 5 issues (1 for each group member).
                                          As described in the above, we want to optimize the quality of our work and we believe this limit would suit that goal. Since we all have 
                                          full course loads during this period, this limit will also not overwhelm any member during the project. For this same reason, we have decided
                                           that instead of having daily synchronization meetings, it would be more realistic for the group to have 3 quick discussions per week that will
                                            go over the tasks for each member on the Trello board.
