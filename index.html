                                <p>Module design pattern</p>
                                <p>Every component is a module. In Javascript, module is an object with public and private parts.
                                This is utilized well in the project because components need to share data and methods between each other.
                                For example in the UML we can see how this design pattern helps to decouple <strong>background component</strong> and <strong>intents component</strong>.
                                Background is responsible of running intents (in intentRunner.js) but the logic is in 
                                intents component. So intents expose its data and functions to background through module design pattern.
                                This way the implementation of intentRunner and implementation of the actual intents are decoupled.</p>
                                    <p>Here is an example of on of the module from intent. </p>

                                    popupView.jsx to return the render component</p>
                                <p>
                                    It then tells React to render the component in the popup-container div. The
                                    PopupController has a useEffect() hook that immediately:

                                        <p>recording (creates a ShimRecorder and sends message to background script,
                                            calls startRecorder, which sends a message to background script to start
                                            recording, which is picked up by recorder.js and calls startRecording in
                                            voice.js)
                                            after rendering the popup.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    The logic to handle recording is done in vad.js. It starts a WebRTC session and
                                    creates a Promise that contains either the voice data or an error.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It uses the native MediaRecorder API to record the voice and sends a message to the
                                    background script to temporarily mute other browser tabs. Once it finishes
                                    recording, it makes a POST request with the audio for speech recognition.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The PopupController receives the response and sends a message to the background script to run an intent.
                                    The intent runner then handles the actual running of the intent.

                                        href="#top">#back to top</a></h4>

                                <p>In the open source community, the requirements and specifications of a project may
                                    not be well defined in the beginning. Customers and users will request more features
                                    as they utilize the software and provide feedback to developers. They have to
                                    accommodate their changing requirements and expectations accordingly in the
                                    incremental development process. Furthermore, the Incremental Development Process
                                    allows developers to make changes at a relatively lower cost compared to other
                                    software development processes such as Waterfall. Customers can use the product
                                    earlier in alpha and beta phases to gain value, but also to provide valuable
                                    feedback to developers. On the development side, it is also a good idea to maximize
                                    the market share as soon as possible.

                                </p>
                                <p>We also considered other software development processes. Firstly, waterfall
                                    development does not suit our needs in our open source project since we do not have
                                    a clear vision of all the requirements and specifications before we start working on
                                    the project. There are always new issues regarding new features on top of the
                                    existing ones. The inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes
                                    it very difficult for developers to collect feedback from users and make changes in
                                    the requirements accordingly. Reuse-oriented software development process is also a
                                    poor choice for our workflow, because the project focuses on an innovative voice
                                    command tool. As relatively new technology, there are limited components for us to
                                    reuse to implement voice navigation on browsers. The spiral process is good for
                                    analyzing product risks in every development phase iteratively. However, it is not a
                                    good choice because a voice command extension on Firefox is not a life critical
                                    product so there is a relatively low risk in the various phases of planning,
                                    implementation and delivery. The advantages of being able to identify and account
                                    for more risks in every development phase does not apply to our situation. In fact,
                                    the excessive amount of risk analysis is too costly for rapid development and
                                    delivery. </p>

                                <p>Although incremental development process suits our purpose the best for our voice
                                    command extension project, there are some drawbacks in incremental development
                                    process as well. It is not cost-effective to make documentation to every version of
                                    the software in a rapid development process since the requirements and
                                    specifications are too quickly. Furthermore, the system architecture tends to
                                    degrade as the development goes as more and more new features are added unless the
                                    development team spends extra time and energy to refactor the codebase. Otherwise,
                                    there is a risk for technical debt to pile up in the future as the software becomes
                                    harder to maintain and develop.

                                <h4 id="line5_2">Why we chose to use Kanban <a href="#top">#back to top</a></h4>
                                <p>There are several reasons as to why our team chose Kanban as our software development
                                    methodology. One of these reasons is the aspect of the Kanban board. We can
                                    customize the columns of the board to suit our teams needs as well as providing us
                                    the ability of visualizing our progress as we continue work on deliverables. The
                                    fact that Kanban emphasizes limiting the “Work in Progress” section on the board is
                                    a very good way of ensuring the highest quality of work that we deliver, without
                                    sacrificing delivery times. Another aspect of Kanban that could work very well for
                                    our team is the use of daily synchronization meetings in front of the Kanban board.
                                    These are used to help the team keep track of their tasks as well as being aware of
                                    the work other members are doing. Kanban works well because it has the concept of
                                    “everyone owns the board”. This means that instead of assigning roles to each member
                                    of the team, every single person is equally responsible in updating the board as
                                    there exists a collective responsibility among all members to collaborate with each
                                    other. Although we are given the requirements of each deliverable ahead of time,
                                    group projects can sometimes be unpredictable. Because of this, we appreciate the
                                    flexibility of Kanban as we can quickly pivot into pulling in different issues and
                                    re-assigning to members of the team.

                                <h4 id="line5_3">Comparing Kanban with Scrum and XP <a href="#top">#back to top</a></h4>
                                <p>One of the main aspects of XP is the idea of promoting strong engineering practices
                                    into the development of the tasks, as well as promoting an extremely strict priority
                                    order given by the customers. For Scrum, there is no need for a priority order, as
                                    the members of the team follow the order specified at the beginning of the iteration
                                    determined by the scrum master. For Kanban, our team uses the flexibility of pulling
                                    issues into the WIP section and moving issues into the “To-Do” sections when
                                    requirements tend to change so we can rapidly adjust to the constant changes. Since
                                    Scrum is very strict on the issues first discussed at the beginning of the
                                    iterations, we would not be allowed this type of flexibility. XP depends heavily on
                                    the priorities of the customer that we are dealing with. With the nature of an open
                                    source project, it would be difficult in communicating with the users as we do not
                                    have direct access into the company that is creating the project. Also, with Kanban,
                                    we can be more engaged in determining task priorities. Another aspect where Scrum
                                    differs is the idea of assigning roles to team members. Our team feels that we can
                                    be more effective with all members having an equal contribution level to the Kanban
                                    board, as well as priorities of the issues.

                                <p>As a group, we have agreed on various aspects of the Kanban methodology in order to
                                    optimize for the schedules of the team members and ensure that we submit exceptional
                                    work for the deliverables. First, we have decided to use Trello as our Kanban board
                                    of choice (link below). Trello is free and easy to use and allows us to customize

                                <p>Backlog, To-Do, Doing, Testing, Review and Done. </p>
                                <p> Each member is asked to update tasks on the Trello board progressively when working
                                    on an issue.
                                    Group members will be responsible for reviewing the work of the other group members
                                    before
                                    submitting the deliverables and is why we have included the “Review” column into our
                                    Trello board.
                                    A piece of customization that we have implemented into the board is limiting the
                                    “Doing” section with 5 issues (1 for each group member).
                                    As described in the above, we want to optimize the quality of our work and we
                                    believe this limit would suit that goal. Since we all have
                                    full course loads during this period, this limit will also not overwhelm any member
                                    during the project. For this same reason, we have decided
                                    that instead of having daily synchronization meetings, it would be more realistic
                                    for the group to have 3 quick discussions per week that will
                                    go over the tasks for each member on the Trello board.
